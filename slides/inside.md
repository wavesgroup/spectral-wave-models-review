## How do spectral wave models work?
</section>


<section>

## Fundamental principles

* Small-amplitude waves over slowly-varying currents and bathymetry
* Solve for wave energy distribution, not exactly elevation
</section>



<section>

## Governing equation

Conservation of wave action, $\mathcal{N} = \mathcal{E} / \sigma$:

$$
\frac{\partial \mathcal{N}}{\partial t} + \nabla{Cg \mathcal{N}} = 0
$$

$\mathcal{N}$ is (mostly) conserved for small-amplitude waves on slowly-varying
currents (Bretherton & Garrett, 1968)

## The good, the bad, and the ugly of spectral wave models
</section>

<section>

## The good

* One governing equation
* Largely wind-driven
* Linear equation (no chaos)

</section>

<section>

## The bad

* Highly multidimensional
* Computationally dense

</section>

<section>

## The ugly

* Sources and sinks
* We don't fully understand how waves grow
* We don't fully understand how waves dissipate
* We don't fully understand how waves interact with each other
