## Wave growth by wind ($S_{in}$)

* Several partly competing theories and interpretations: Jeffreys (1924), Phillips (1957), Miles (1957), Belcher (1990), etc.
* All share the idea that waves grow by opposing pressure anomalies
on the two sides of a wave crest.

## Wind input in a nutshell

$$
S_{in} \propto \frac{\rho_a}{\rho_w} \left( \frac{u_x}{c_p} \right)^n \omega F
$$
